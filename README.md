# Aldoodle

A copy of Google's QuickDraw, with the addition that the doodling is done with a finger, in front of the webcam, not by using a mouse.

### Prerequisites

To use the app, all you need is a webcam and to create an Anaconda environment based on the .yml file I have provided.

## Usage

Place the palm of your hand in the 9 small squares shown on screen. Once aligned, press Z. After that, simply keep X pressed to draw. When you are finished drawing, press space to predict the shape.
